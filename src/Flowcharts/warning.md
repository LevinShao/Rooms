When you first open these files in Flowgorithm, you may see there's nothing in them. That's because you're seeing these flowcharts in the wrong function.

Go to the toolbar and click on the button next to the function manager that should have the text "Main" on it. Switch the function from Main to BEGIN, and now there will be a full flowchart!

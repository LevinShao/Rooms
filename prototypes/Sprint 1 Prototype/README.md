# Doors Game CLI Prototype (v1)

Hello there! This is a text-based adventure inspired by the Roblox game **Doors**, where players navigate through 100 procedurally generated rooms while fighting monsters and solving puzzles on their way.

## Features
- Move forward/backward through rooms with `W`/`S` keys  
- Randomized room descriptions
- Victory screen at Room 100 with replay option  
- Typing animation effect for immersive text  

## How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Run:
   ```bash
   python main.py

## Installation Procedure
Absolutely none! An installation procedure is not needed because there are nothing that needs to be installed before playing the game. Therefore requirements.txt is not needed as well because there are no modules whatsoever that needs to be downloaded. Just get in there and run the game!

## How to Play

Key | Action
| - | -
W | Move forward
S | Move backward
Q | Quit game

**Playtime:** ~2-3 minutes to complete (Zero risks of death!)

## Important Notice:

This is a prototype, so there no enemies and puzzles yet! However, future versions will add:
- Monsters and obstacles
- Inventory system
- Dark rooms, locked doors and other special events

Stay tuned!

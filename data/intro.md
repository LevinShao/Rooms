The lights above flicker as you wake up in an empty, abandoned building. The door creaks in front of you, slightly ajar.
Dizzy and lightheaded, you get up, go to the window and look outside. The heavy rain splash onto the window fiercely as thunder rumbles in the distance.
You look around scared and confused, but you could not remember when or how you got here, no matter how hard you tried.

But you do know two things - SURVIVE AND ESCAPE.

This is no ordinary building. Rooms shift as you blink.  
Monsters lurk in the darkness, seeking every chance to catch and kill you.
A tiny little mistake could end up costing your life.
But you must keep trying, because beyond Room 100 - is freedom.

Armed with nothing but your fraying sanity, you must navigate 100 rooms of ever-deepening horror.
This journey will not be easy. You are all on your own.
As you progress, difficult puzzles and obstacles wait for you. Do you think you got what it takes to escape?

You have the option to either surrender now, or embark on a journey that could change you forever.
Choose quickly and wisely, the doors wonâ€™t stay closed forever...

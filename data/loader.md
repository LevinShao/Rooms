Hello there, adventurer, and welcome to The Navigation Game!

This is a fantasy adventure game where you embark on a journey as valiant knight, on a quest to rescue the fair princess, Daphne, from the clutches of an evil and powerful entity known as Duke Dennis. You are navigating your way through the castle of a dark wizard by the name of Kai Cenat, who has enchanted it with treacherous monsters and obstacles. In the mysterious caverns below the castle, your odyssey continues against the awesome forces that oppose your efforts to reach and save the princess. 

As you try to find Daphne, the ghostly voice in your head (who wants to be known as Ray Wing) will give you tips and advice along the way, although some could be unhelpful.

Lead on, adventurer, if you dare. Your quest awaits!
